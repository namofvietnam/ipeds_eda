# Methods to pull data from the  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and exploratory data analyses
The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is a useful database for decision-makers up and down the higher education landscape, from highschoolers looking to choose colleges to college presidents looking to advance their institutions against peers. If an institution receives Title IV federal funding, they are required to submit accurate and timely data to IPEDS.

IPEDS data can be fetched from https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/colleges.html, which has several types of data into higher education and convenient ways to get data with Python, R, or download.

Another source for more updated IPEDS data is IPEDS data center. Users would need to download csv or Access files from this source. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/InstitutionByName.aspx?goToReportId=1
